## What it does
Create and remove virtual audio devices â€” a virtual input paired with a virtual output.

## Why use it
Capture your microphone's audio in OBS, apply processing (like noise filters), monitor audio, and route it to a virtual output.
For apps without built-in noise suppression, you can feed the processed audio through a virtual input.

## How to use it
* In the first text field, enter the name of your virtual output.
* In the second text field, enter the name of your virtual input.
* Choose between stereo and mono in the drop-down menu.
* Click Create.  
  
**Done!**

Your virtual output will appear among your speakers or headphones.  
Your virtual input will appear among your microphones.  

> [!WARNING]
> Virtual devices are temporary and will be removed after reboot.
